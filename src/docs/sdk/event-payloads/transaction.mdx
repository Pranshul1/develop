title: Transaction Payloads

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](../envelopes) and therefore also be sent to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info">

Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More infromation can be found on the [Envelope](../envelopes) page.

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](./span) combined with an [Event](/sdk/event-payloads/). When using 
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is a Span. A Transaction must also have a `contexts.trace` (which contains some data of the [Span](./span)) and some other
properties that will be covered in the next section.

## Required Attributes

Transactions are generally very similar to [Events](/sdk/event-payloads/) and therefore
share the most properties. Transactions will be enriched with data from the [Span](./Span).
