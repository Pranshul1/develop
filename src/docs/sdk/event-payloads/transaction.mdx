title: Transaction Payloads
---

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](/sdk/envelopes/) and therefore also be sent to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info">

Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More information can be found on the [Envelope](../envelopes) page.

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span) combined with an [Event](/sdk/event-payloads/). When using 
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is just a Span. A Transaction must also have a `contexts.trace` (which contains some data of the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span)) and some other
properties that will be covered in the next section.

Transactions is an [Events](/sdk/event-payloads/) which will be enriched with data from the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span).
We are only going to list here whats important for a Transaction.

### contexts.trace

A Transaction has to have a specifc `contexts.trace` entry that contains data from the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span).

import "./properties/span_id.mdx"

import "./properties/parent_span_id.mdx"

import "./properties/trace_id.mdx"

import "./properties/op.mdx"

import "./properties/description.mdx"

## Examples

```json
{
    "contexts": {
        "trace": {
            "op": "navigation",
            "description": "User clicked on <Link />",
            "trace_id": "743ad8bbfdd84e99bc38b4729e2864de",
            "span_id": "a0cfbde2bdff3adc"
        }
    }
}
