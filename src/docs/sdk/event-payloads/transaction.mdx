title: Transaction Payloads

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](../envelopes) and there also send to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info">
Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More infromation can be found on the [Envelope](../envelopes) page.

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](./span) combined with an [Event](./index). When using 
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is a Span.

## Required Attributes

Transactions are generally very similar to [Events](./index) and therefore
share the most properties. Transactions will be enriched with data from the [Span](./Span).
